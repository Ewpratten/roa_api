# Public Route Origin Authorization API

This is the repository for `roa.va3zza.com`, a public tool that auto-generates [Bird2](https://bird.network.cz/)-style [ROA](https://www.arin.net/resources/manage/rpki/roa_request/) data for IP space that doesn't play nice with standard IRR tools.

Currently, the following networks are supported:

- [AMPRNet](https://www.ampr.org/)
  - `https://roa.va3zza.com/api/amprnet`
- [DN42](https://dn42.eu)
  - `https://roa.va3zza.com/api/dn42_ipv4`
  - `https://roa.va3zza.com/api/dn42_ipv6`
